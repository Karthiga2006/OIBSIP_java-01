# OIBSIP_java-01
The ATM Management System is a console-based application developed using Java, designed to simulate the real-world working of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This project provides a practical implementation of core Java programming concepts and demonstrates how user interaction, authentication, and transaction processing can be handled efficiently in a command-line environment.
This system is ideal for academic projects, internship submissions, and beginner-level software development practice.

⚙️ How the System Works
The user is prompted to enter a PIN for authentication
Upon successful login, the ATM menu is displayed
The user can select operations such as:
Check Balance
Deposit Money
Withdraw Money
Exit
Each transaction is processed securely and the account balance is updated instantly
The system continues until the user chooses to exit
